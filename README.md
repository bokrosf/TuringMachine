# TuringMachine

A Turing machine library that allows creating machines with user defined state and symbol types. Users can define their own machine types and able to track computation progress.

Setting up the machine happens both declaratively and programmatically. Transitions are defined declaratively while computation progress tracking happens by subscribing to events.

Project uses .NET 8 and C# 12.
